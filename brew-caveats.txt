android-sdk

Now run the 'android' tool to install the actual SDK stuff.

The Android-SDK location for IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ etc is:
  /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/23.0.2

You will have to install the platform-tools and docs EVERY time this formula
updates. If you want to try and fix this then see the comment in this formula.

You may need to add the following to your .bashrc:
  export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/opt/android-sdk
